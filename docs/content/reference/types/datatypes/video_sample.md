A video sample.

Similar to a frame of video, but decoding a full frame typically requires more than one sample.

Samples can either be key frames or delta frames. Only key frames have enough data to decode a full frame,
delta frames always require the context of a key frame and possibly also some number of preceding delta
frames to decode a full frame.

The type of a given sample is implicit in its position in the [`datatypes.VideoSegment`](https://rerun.io/docs/reference/types/datatypes/video_segment) it belongs to,
where the first sample is always a key frame.
